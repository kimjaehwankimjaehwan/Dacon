        "1. 그래프(Graph) 구조:\n",
        "\n",
        " * 노드(Node): 그래프의 개별 요소입니다. 예를 들어, 화학 구조에서 노드는 원자를 나타낼 수 있습니다.\n",
        " * 엣지(Edge): 노드 간의 연결을 나타내며, 노드 사이의 관계나 상호작용을 표현합니다. 화학 구조에서 엣지는 원자 간의 결합을 나타냅니다.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. GNN의 작동 방식:\n",
        "\n",
        " * 메시지 전달(Message Passing): GNN의 핵심 아이디어는 각 노드가 자신의 이웃 노드로부터 메시지를 받아 자신의 상태를 업데이트하는 것입니다. 이 과정에서 노드는 자신과 연결된 이웃 노드들로부터 정보를 수집하고, 이를 바탕으로 자신의 표현(representation)을 갱신합니다.\n",
        " * 노드 업데이트(Node Update): 각 노드는 자신의 상태와 이웃 노드들로부터 받은 메시지를 바탕으로 새로운 상태를 계산합니다. 이 과정은 여러 번 반복되며, 그래프의 모든 노드들이 서로의 정보를 점차 반영하게 됩니다.\n",
        " * 그래프 풀링(Graph Pooling): 노드의 정보를 집계하여 그래프 전체의 표현을 생성할 수 있습니다. 이는 그래프 수준의 예측을 위해 필요합니다.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. GNN의 적용 사례:\n",
        "\n",
        " * 화합물 예측: 화학 분자의 SMILES 표현을 그래프 구조로 변환하여 각 원자를 노드로, 결합을 엣지로 표현합니다. GNN을 통해 분자 내 원자 간의 상호작용을 학습하여, 화합물의 물리화학적 특성이나 생물학적 활성을 예측할 수 있습니다.\n",
        " * 소셜 네트워크 분석: 소셜 네트워크에서 사람들은 노드로, 친구 관계는 엣지로 표현됩니다. GNN을 사용하여 사용자 간의 관계를 분석하거나, 특정 사용자의 행동을 예측할 수 있습니다.\n",
        " * 지식 그래프: 지식 그래프에서 개념들(예: \"사과\", \"과일\")이 노드로, 이들 간의 관계(예: \"is a\")가 엣지로 표현됩니다. GNN은 이들 간의 복잡한 관계를 학습하여 새로운 사실을 추론하거나, 그래프 내에서 노드를 분류할 수 있습니다.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. GNN의 종류:\n",
        "\n",
        " * GCN(Graph Convolutional Network): 그래프 데이터에서 전통적인 CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)의 아이디어를 확장하여, 노드의 이웃 정보를 이용해 새로운 노드 표현을 계산하는 모델입니다.\n",
        " * GAT(Graph Attention Network): GCN의 확장으로, 노드 간의 중요도에 따라 가중치를 달리하여 정보를 수집하는 모델입니다.\n",
        " * GraphSAGE: 샘플링 기법을 사용해 대규모 그래프에서도 효율적으로 학습할 수 있도록 설계된 모델입니다.\n",
        "\n",
        "###GNN의 특징 및 장점\n",
        "* 복잡한 관계 학습: GNN은 그래프 구조에서 노드 간의 복잡한 관계를 자연스럽게 모델링할 수 있습니다.\n",
        "* 유연성: 그래프는 다양한 형태의 데이터를 표현할 수 있으므로, GNN은 화학, 소셜 네트워크, 지식 그래프 등 다양한 분야에 적용될 수 있습니다.\n",
        "* 비정형 데이터 처리: GNN은 정형화된 데이터(예: 표 형태의 데이터)보다 훨씬 유연하게 다양한 데이터 구조를 처리할 수 있습니다.\n",
        "\n",
        "###GNN의 한계\n",
        "* 계산 비용: 그래프의 크기나 복잡도에 따라 GNN의 계산 비용이 크게 증가할 수 있습니다.\n",
        "* 그래프 구조 필요: GNN을 적용하려면 데이터가 그래프 형태로 표현 가능해야 합니다. 이는 모든 데이터에 GNN을 적용할 수 없다는 것을 의미합니다."
